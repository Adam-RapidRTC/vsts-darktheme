Dark theme CSS for VSTS &amp; TFS

## Overview
This project, if that's what we are calling it, spawned out of my hatred for switching from my beautiful dark themes VS, Sublime, Notepad++, SQL to the awful white theme in VSTS. After some quick googling it was discovered that VSTS doesn't support a dark theme and the kind random strangers on the internet had almost already solved the problem by using custom stylesheets. So being the developer that I am I quickly copied and pasted the code and claimed it as my own, as is tradition. After some tweaks to an already great stylesheet I ended up with what is here and decided to share.
